# saahil-s-Robotic-Arm-with-3D-Computer-Vision
This is a showcase of a project from Fermilab I had the opportunity to be involved in for my senior design project. Due to an NDA contract, the code cannot be shown.

On April 19th, I had the pleasure of presenting our senior design project at UIC's EXPO event. My team and I worked with Fermilab to produce an autonomous robotic arm with 3D computer vision. While working on this project, I learned the capabilities of robotics with machine learning and how they can help people stay safe from radioactivity with high-energy experiments.

I am incredibly proud to announce that our team was voted best in the show. Thank you to all my team members and faculty advisors for making this happen!
